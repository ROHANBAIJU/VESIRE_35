**SJBIT Hackathon — Team Introduction**

Hello! We're **VESIRE**, a student team participating in the SJBIT Hackathon. We're excited to collaborate, learn, and build something meaningful once the problem statements are released.

## Team Members
- **Ananya** — Lead  
- **Sruthi**  
- **Joel**  
- **Srijan**  
- **Rohan**

## About Us
We are a group of enthusiastic students brought together by a shared curiosity for problem-solving and creativity. Right now we're waiting for the official problem statement to be disclosed. Once it's out, we'll brainstorm ideas, pick an approach, and get to work.

## What to Expect
- A friendly, collaborative environment.  
- Quick iteration and experimentation once the prompt is revealed.  
- Focus on delivering a clear, user-focused solution.

## Communication
We'll coordinate internally with our chosen collaboration tools (chat, calls, and a shared code repo). More details will be added here as we decide on roles and workflow.

## Contact
If you want to reach any of us, check the repository collaborators or get in touch through the hackathon channels.
